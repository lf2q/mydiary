    This application was written by author jysh on May 7, 2019.This is the third version I wrote.The interface and functions are not much different from the previous version,but there are many optimizations in the code, much better than the previous code.

    This project is completely open source, you can modify the source code at will.Code Warehouse Address: https://github.com/lf2q/mydiary.git

    The first purpose of writing this application is to verify the Android knowledge you have learned,and the second is to record your life with a diary software you like.
